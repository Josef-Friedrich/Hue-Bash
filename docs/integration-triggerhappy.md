title: Integration with triggerhappy
---

`Hue-shell` provides a 
[configuration file]({{ site.repo_master }}/triggerhappy/hue-shell.conf)
for [triggerhappy](https://github.com/wertarbyte/triggerhappy).

Triggerhappy is a lightweight hotkey daemon and allows to control the
Hue lights with keyboard shortcuts. If you have already installed
triggerhappy and the directory `/etc/triggerhappy/triggers.d` exists,
the install script puts the config file on the right place.
