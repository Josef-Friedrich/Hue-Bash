`Hue-shell` is a collection of shell scripts to control the Hue lamps
from Philips. 

It is designed for embedded operating systems with very limited
resources (successfully tested on the old and outdated wifi router 
"Linksys WRT54GL"). 

`Hue-shell` runs on many shells (sh, dash, ash, bash) and many UNIX
operating systems (Linux, MacOS X, FreeBSD, OpenWRT). `Hue-shell` works
well in a small BusyBox environment. Out of the box `Hue-shell` runs on
many single-board computer like Raspberry Pi, Cubieboard, BeagleBone 
etc.
